## Announcement
In generally speaking for all assignments, You will be asked to create a circuit that will be given to you in the assignment. You will be asked to take a screenshot of the circuit you created on Digital simulation software and upload it to the repo. You will also be asked to embed the screenshot in the README file(this file). If applicable, you should run the simulation and change inputs accordingly and save gif(s). Karnaugh Map and Truth Table outputs maybe also be needed. Assignment requirements will explicitly written at each assignment.

## Assignment 1
### Due Date: 23.10.2023 @ 23:50
This assignment will all be about examining and understanding the *_Digital_* simulation program. All the components in the Equipment List will be investigated, examined and tested by you on [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital/releases).

## Tasks
1- Examine the Digital simulation software deeply, try to use as many components as possible from Equipments list. Combine multiple components, give inputs and outputs, rename inputs and outputs of components. You can use [Digital User Guide](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital/releases/download/v0.30/Doc_English.pdf) for help.  
2- Below is a screenshots part of Readme. Remove everything under screenshots and replace it with your own screenshots. You can also add more screenshots if you want. If you embed your images by uploading them to the repo, please rename them to something meaningful.  
3- Save and Upload your circuit Digital design file to the repo like **Example-Circuit.dig**. 

### Screenshots
It is up to you, how to take screenshot but I suggest using [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) You can directly create gif for example. Simulator also has export as options.
